# annihilation-operator
An annihilation operator (usually denoted  a^{\hat {a}}_{n}) lowers the number of particles in a given state by one.
The new state, after the action of the annihilation operator in the n^{th} position of the state will be a coefficient of {\sqrt{n}} and the new state will now possess n-1 particles in the n^{th} position of the original, starting state in which the annihilation operator a^{\hat {a}}_{n} acted.
